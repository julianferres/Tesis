abstract = {A smart contract is a computer program that allows users to automate their actions
on the blockchain platform. Given the significance of smart contracts in supporting
important activities across industry sectors including supply chain, finance, legal,
and medical services, there is a strong demand for verification and validation techniques.
Yet, the vast majority of smart contracts lack any kind of formal specification, which
is essential for establishing their correctness. In this survey, we investigate formal
models and specifications of smart contracts presented in the literature and present
a systematic overview to understand the common trends. We also discuss the current
approaches used in verifying such property specifications and identify gaps with the
hope to recognize promising directions for future work.},

abstract="Blockchains allow the specification of contracts in the form of programs that guarantee their fulfilment. Nevertheless, errors in those programs can cause important, and often irretrievable, monetary loss. General-purpose languages provide a platform on which contracts can be built, but by their very generality they have the potential to exhibit behaviours of an unpredictable kind, and are also not easy to read or comprehend for general users.",
