Nevertheless, errors in those programs can cause important, and often irretrievable, monetary loss. General-purpose languages provide a platform on which contracts can be built, but by their very generality they have the potential to exhibit behaviours of an unpredictable kind, and are also not easy to read or comprehend for general users.},

  abstract   = {A smart contract is a computer program that allows users to automate their actions
                on the blockchain platform. Given the significance of smart contracts in supporting
                important activities across industry sectors including supply chain, finance, legal,
                and medical services, there is a strong demand for verification and validation techniques.
                Yet, the vast majority of smart contracts lack any kind of formal specification, which
                is essential for establishing their correctness. In this survey, we investigate formal
                models and specifications of smart contracts presented in the literature and present
                a systematic overview to understand the common trends. We also discuss the current
                approaches used in verifying such property specifications and identify gaps with the
                hope to recognize promising directions for future work.},

We establish security properties for the protocol comparable to those achieved by the bitcoin blockchain protocol. As the protocol provides a {\textquotedblleft}proof of stake{\textquotedblright} blockchain discipline, it offers qualitative efficiency advantages over blockchains based on proof of physical resources (e.g., proof of work). We also present a novel reward mechanism for incentivizing proof of stake protocols and we prove that, given this mechanism, honest behavior is an approximate Nash equilibrium, thus neutralizing attacks such as selfish mining. We also present initial evidence of the practicality of our protocol in real world settings by providing experimental results on transaction confirmation and processing.},
